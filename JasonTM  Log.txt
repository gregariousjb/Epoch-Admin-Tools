In compiles.sqf func_veh_setFixserver is compiled in the (isServer) section and the client side public variable has been removed, so I don't think it is available to client side scripts.

Removed fnc_veh_setFixserver and replaced the code using examples from the repair vehicle section in the service points script updated by salival.

4. backpack.sqf

Cannot create non-ai vehicle TentStorageDomed2,

Substituted classname TentStorage

Tents only have 5 backpack slots, 2 backpacks spawn outside of the tent.

Remove DZ_TK_Assault_Pack_EP1 and DZ_British_ACU from EAT_backpackCrateContents reducing the total backpacks in the array to 5.

////////////Battleye Filters///////////////

Changed some of the dialogs associated with public variable EAT_PVEH_usageLogger because having words like spawn and enable causes all kinds of misery in publicvariableval.txt.

Cannot get Invisibility mode to work. remoteexec.txt exception to work.

messageDialog.sqf not working. Messages do not show up on the screen.

Rebound teleport to F7 because F1 is reserved for earplugs. Updated the menu dialog.

//Variables.sqf
Replaced {DayZ_SafeObjects = DayZ_SafeObjects + [_x select 2];}forEach EAT_allBuildingList;

With DayZ_SafeObjects = DayZ_SafeObjects + EAT_buildResidential + EAT_buildIndustrial + EAT_buildMilitary + EAT_buildReligious + EAT_buildGrave + EAT_buildCastle + EAT_buildOre + EAT_buildOther;

Still does not work.

Changed backpack classname "DZ_Czech_Vest_Puch" to "DZ_Czech_Vest_Pouch" in aiSpawn.sqf

Battleye filters update 5-10-2017

scripts.txt line 7 attachTo is a major problem. I set it to 1 for log only and it spams the shit out of the log file. I cannot see where the errors are generated from. The keywork is not referenced at all. I suspect keyboard.sqf. I have it commented out for now.

Fixed the battleye filter in remoteexec to allow invisibility mode.

The waypoints files are set to 1. I don't see how to have them set to 5 and allow ai spawning.
