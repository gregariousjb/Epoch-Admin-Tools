### Before you begin
This is an open source project meant to make facilitating a DayZ Epoch or similar server as easy as possible. The goal of this project is to make the gaming experience as great as possible so that everyone has fun and players can enjoy your server as much as you want them to. It is important to know that these tools are little different from a hacker's tools, so make sure administrative power is only given to those who will not abuse it.

#### Code of Conduct
All comments, issue repots, and pull requests must maintain a high level of professionalism. The people contributing to this project either through reports, code, or help are doing so for free. They have donated their valuable time to this project so that you and others can use it to better their servers and playing experience. Rude, vulgar, or hostile conduct will not be tolerated because of this. Please respect everyone.
